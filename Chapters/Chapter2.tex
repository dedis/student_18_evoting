\section{Election Data Structure}

\subsection{Skipchains}

The evoting system makes extensive use of a tamper proof blockchain-like data structure called Skipchains \cite{skipchains}. An amalgamation of blockchain and skiplists, Skipchains allow clients to traverse forward and backwards in a linear data structure using multi hop links in logarithmic time with respect to the length of the chain. As in blockchains, the backward links are cryptographic hashes of the previous blocks. However, the forward links are collective cryptographic signatures of future blocks and are added once the future block is stored. Each additional cosignature on a forward link represents the fact that a witness (a node) examined the block and agrees it follows the verification rules of the evoting system.

The evoting state is maintained in the skipchain with the state being the concatenation of data in all blocks of the skipchain. The subsections below elaborate how the data is actually stored and represented in the skipchain.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Master Skipchain}

The evoting service is built to support multiple independent elections from the ground up. The global configuration common to a set of elections, and references to those elections themselves are stored in a Skipchain called the Master Skipchain.

Figure \ref{fig:MasterSkipchain} shows an example of a Master Skipchain. The first block, called the genesis block, is empty and contains no data. The next block, called the Master Block contains the following configuration info:

\begin{itemize}
\item Admins: a list of unique 6 digit identifiers for denoting election administrators who may create new elections and finalise them. These identifiers, called \textit{SCIPER}s are used to identify every person across EPFL. 
\item Nodes: a list of servers, called conodes which will participate in the election process.
\item Key: an Ed25519 Public Key used to \hyperref[sec:auth]{verify user authentication signature}.
\end{itemize}

The remaining blocks, called the Link blocks are references to Election Skipchains described in the next subsection. It should be noted that the configuration in the master skipchain may change over time with the addition of new Master blocks. The configuration defined in the latest Master Skipblock wins.

\subsection{Election Skipchain}

All information associated with a particular election is stored in a sidechain, called the Election Skipchain. The Master Skipchain stores a reference to the genesis block of this sidechain in Link Skipblocks.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Figures/ElectionSkipchain.png}
    \rule{35em}{0.5pt}
  \caption[Election Skipchain]{Election Skipchain}
  \label{fig:ElectionSkipchain}
\end{figure}

As depicted in Figure \ref{fig:ElectionSkipchain}, the Election Skipchain contains an Election block which stores information associated with the specific election. It contains the following configuration values:

\begin{itemize}
\item Name: Election Title with support for translations in different languages.
\item Creator: Identifier of the administrator who created the election.
\item Users: list of identifiers of users who may vote in this election.
\item Election Public Key: an aggregate public key generated using the DKG Protocol \cite{dkg}, which is used to \hyperref[sec:dkg]{encrypt the ballots}.
\item Stage: the current status of election determined at run time. It may be Running i.e. users may cast their vote, Shuffled i.e. the ballots have been mixed or Decrypted i.e. the ballots have been decrypted by participating nodes using their share of the secret key.
\item Subtitle: Election Subtitle with support for translations in different languages
\item Start: Timestamp of the election start.
\item End: Timestamp of the election end.
\item Metadata: other keys which store metadata related to the election, including the department name, contact person details etc.
\end{itemize}

After the Election Block, the election skipchain consists of a series of Ballot blocks which are stored whenever a user casts a vote. The contents of the Ballot Block include an encrypted ElGamal Ciphertext using the Election Public Key described above.  The encryption algorithm proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item When a user, say Alice, wants to cast her ballot, the frontend client first encodes the ballot. Each candidate's \textit{SCIPER} is encoded using 3 bytes and upto 9 such \textit{SCIPER}s may be encoded in a ballot. Since the point size is 32 bytes, the remaining bytes are randomly filled such that the resulting 32 byte buffer is a valid point $M$ on the Edwards form of Curve 25519 \cite{ed25519}.
  \item The client then selects a random value \( r \in \mathbb{Z}_{n} \) and computes \( u = rG \) and \( v = M + rY \) where $Y$ is the Election Public Key.
  \item The client then sends the pair \( (u, v) \) to the server for storage in the skipchain.
\end{enumerate}

The Ballot Block also contains an identifier for the user who cast the vote. Since the evoting system allows a user to cast multiple ballots, this field is used to determine the last cast ballot for every user before performing the first shuffle. This design can also be used to send a reminder to users who haven't cast their vote yet.

Once the election is finalised, the election administrator may initiate the shuffle and decrypt protocol which result in the addition of Shuffle and Decrypt blocks in the skipchain. Each shuffle block contains a permutation of last cast ballot by every user which participated in the election and a verifiable proof of the mix which is verified by a threshold number of nodes before the block is stored in the skipchain. A threshold number of participating nodes then add their decryption share to the skipchain in the form of Decrypt blocks. These decryptions are performed on the ballots contained in the last shuffle block in the skipchain.

The implementation can be divided into three different components

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A web server that serves static HTML and Javascript files that make up the frontend client.
  \item A web server that acts as an intermediary to authenticate a user against EPFL’s authentication system.
  \item A set of servers, called a \textit{cothority}, with each individual server called a \textit{conode}, which are responsible for handling various protocols associated with the election in a distributed manner.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Frontend Webserver}
The frontend server is responsible for serving static HTML and Javascript files to the client. This can be done using any appropriate web server like Nginx. The frontend client configuration contains a reference to the Hash of the Master Skipchain and is used to fetch the list of all elections a user may participate in.

\subsection{Authentication Server}
\label{sec:auth}
The authentication server is a Node.js webserver that facilitates authentication between the user and Tequila, EPFL’s authentication service \cite{tequila}. Tequila allows users to authenticate with the following protocol

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The authentication server sends a POST request to Tequila with the service’s name, redirection URL and requested parameters as the payload. Tequila then replies with a \textit{urlaccess} token.
  \item The authentication server then redirects the user to Tequila. The \textit{urlaccess} token retrieved before is appended as a query parameter to the GET request
  \item Tequila verifies the user details on submission and redirects the user to the redirection URL for the specified \textit{urlaccess} token irrespective of whether the authentication succeeds or not
  \item The authentication server must then send another POST request to Tequila with the \textit{urlaccess} token as a payload. Tequila replies with the user details and parameters requested in the initial request if the authentication was successful or an error is returned otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that as of now Tequila allows verifying the \textit{urlaccess} token mentioned in the last step of the protocol only once. Any further attempt to validate results in an error being returned. This is a limitation in the current design of the evoting service with the authentication server being a single point of failure. On confirmation of successful authentication of the user from Tequila, the authentication server generates a Schnorr signature which is stored in the browser’s localStorage \cite{localStorage}. This signature is used to verify all transactions as described in the next subsection about Cothority.

\subsection{Cothority}

A collective authority (cothority) \cite{cothority} is a set of nodes that witness a particular transaction in a Skipchain and a threshold number of nodes collectively authorise it to be stored. The framework is a research project at the DEDIS laboratory at EPFL, allowing easy deployment of decentralised and distributed services and protocols. The conodes participating in the election run the evoting and skipchain service for orchestrating the elections and storing the data in skipchains respectively.

\section{Protocols}

The evoting system runs protocols at different stages of the election process to perform operations in a distributed manner. The cothority framework helps in the implementation and testing of these distributed protocols.

\subsection{Consensus Protocol (BFTCoSi)}

The skipchain service in cothority implements a byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol, called BFTCosi \cite{bftcosi} . BFTCosi is based on the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) \cite{pbft} algorithm and uses CoSi \cite{cosi}, a collective signing protocol to aggregate thousands of signatures, to scale itself to thousands of nodes. In particular, BFTCoSi uses CoSi's signing rounds to ensure PBFT's \textit{prepare} and \textit{commit} phase scale to thousands of nodes.

During the execution of the consensus protocol, all nodes in the election roster run a custom verifier function to verify the correctness of the data being stored in the skipchain. All transactions that write data to the skipchain have user identity verification as a part of the verification function. This user identification involves validating the  Schnorr signature of the concatenation of user's identifier and the Master Skipchain's Genesis Block Hash against the Authentication Server's public key which is stored in the Master Skipchain's Master Block.

\subsection{Distributed Key Generation (DKG)}
\label{sec:dkg}
The cothority framework contains an implementation of the Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol by Gennaro et. al. \cite{dkg}. The DKG protocol results in the creation of an aggregate public key, and at the same time ensures that the participating nodes hold a share of the secret key and the full secret key is never assembled.

The protocol begins with each node $N_i$ calculating a secret share $s_i$. This is followed by a series of message exchanges that removes potentially malicious nodes and results in a set of qualified nodes \textit{QUAL}. The aggregate secret $x$ is the sum of all the individual secrets of qualified nodes
$x = \sum_{i \in \textit{QUAL}}s_i$. The corresponding public key can be calculated as \(y = gx = g\sum_{i \in \textit{QUAL}}s_i \). The DKG protocol is executed whenever an election administrator requests a new election to be created. Every participating node generates its secret and the aggregate public key is stored in the newly created election skipchain along with other Election Metadata. It is this public key which is used by the frontend client to encrypt the user ballots. The protocol is initialised with a threshold that requires at least \( \lfloor\dfrac{2n}{3}\rfloor + 1 \) nodes to reconstruct the decryptions later where $n$ is the total number of nodes in the roster. The threshold follows from the requirement of having a 2/3rds quorum during the execution of BFTCoSi to store a skipblock.

\subsection{Shuffle}

Once the election ends, the election creator may initiate the shuffle protocol which re-encrypts, permutes and appends the result on the election skipchain providing a proof of the shuffle. The shuffle protocol proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The protocol begins with the leader node being contacted by the client to initiate the shuffle. The leader first checks the presence of a threshold number of shuffles already in the skipchain and exits if so.
  \item In the presence of shuffle blocks lesser than the threshold number required, the leader prepares a list of servers which may participate in this instance of the shuffle, excluding the ones that participated before.
  \item In the first attempt at generating the shuffle, the leader iterates through the election skipchain, finding the last ballot cast by each user and appending it to a list. This list is then passed on as an input to the Neff Shuffle function. On the other hand, other attempts at shuffle rely on the last shuffle that is stored in the skipchain and use it as the input to the Neff Shuffle function.
  \item The Neff Shuffle function then permutes the ballots and outputs a permuted list of ballots and a corresponding proof, containing a vector of Scalars that may be used to verify the shuffle \cite{neff}. The node which created the permutation requests the storage of the shuffle which must be ratified by a threshold of participating conodes in the election. The node also signs its public key and stores it in the skipblock, which is then verified by all the participating nodes during the execution of the verification function.
  \item On receiving a request to store the shuffle block, the  participating nodes verify the identity of the node which proposed the shuffle by checking the signature of the public key included in the transaction. They then ensure that the election skipchain does not already have a threshold number of shuffle blocks and the node which has proposed the given shuffle has not stored a shuffle previously. The nodes then run the Neff Shuffle proof verifying the integrity of the shuffle. If all these checks are ratified by a threshold number of participating nodes the shuffle is stored in the skipchain
  \item The proposer then requests the next server in the list to repeat the shuffle until we get a threshold number of shuffles in the skipchain or the protocol times out.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that the shuffle protocol is resilient to failures due to non-availability of nodes and timeouts. At every attempt, the protocol tries to pick up from the point where it was abandoned.

\subsection{Decrypt}

The decrypt protocol is used to store a threshold number of decryption shares by the participating nodes. The protocol proceeds as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The protocol begins with the leader node being contacted by the client to initiate the decryption. The leader first checks the presence of a threshold number of decryptions already in the skipchain and exits if so.
  \item In the presence of decryptions lesser than the threshold number required, the leader prepares a list of servers which may participate in this instance of the decrypt protocol, excluding the ones that participated before.
  \item The leader then sends a broadcast to the whitelisted servers and prompts them to add their decryption share of the last shuffle stored in the skipchain using their share of the private secret generated during the DKG protocol.
  \item Each node sends its decryption share to the skipchain. The participating nodes run the verification function which checks if the election skipchain has threshold number of shuffles in place, verifies the identity of the proposing node by checking the signature of its public key included in the transaction and checks if the node has not stored its decryption share before.
  \item If all the checks pass, the decryption is stored on the skipchain. The node then sends a reply back to the leader indicating success or failure.
  \item The leader maintains a count of successful decryption shares and ends the protocol as soon as a threshold number of success messages are received.
 \end{enumerate}
 
 Like the shuffle protocol, the decrypt protocol is also resilient to failure due to non-availability of nodes and timeouts. Every reinitialisation of the protocol results in an attempt to pick up from the previous failed attempt.
